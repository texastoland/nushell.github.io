::: warning
The standard library is in alpha development stage. You can find more documentation on [GitHib](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/tree/main/crates/nu-std).

## Signature

```> std iter find {flags} (fn)```

## Parameters

 -  `fn`: the closure used to perform the search


## Input/output types:

| input | output |
| ----- | ------ |
| any   | any    |

## Notes
# Invariant
> The closure has to be a predicate (returning a bool value)
> else `null` is returned
> The closure also has to be valid for the types it receives
> These will be flagged as errors later as closure annotations
> are implemented

# Example
```
use std ["assert equal" "iter find"]

let haystack = ["shell", "abc", "around", "nushell", "std"]

let found = ($haystack | iter find {|it| $it starts-with "a" })
let not_found = ($haystack | iter find {|it| $it mod 2 == 0})

assert equal $found "abc"
assert equal $not_found null
```
